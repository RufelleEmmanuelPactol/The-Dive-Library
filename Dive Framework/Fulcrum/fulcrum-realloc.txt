Contains the equations for the fulcrum-realloc

keep in mind the following variables:
-> positive [empty buckets on the right side of index zero]
        this number gets reduced whenever a push_back() happens
        or when an allocate on the right happens
-> negative [empty buckets on the left side of index zero]
        this number gets reduced whenever a push_front() happens
        or when an allocate on the left happens
-> m_cached_pos
        contains the information about the total number of insertions at right side
-> m_cached_neg
        contains the information about the total number of insertions in the left side
-> capacity
        the total current capacity of the array

realloc at:
-> when pos == 0
-> when neg == 0

using cache:
    ->
